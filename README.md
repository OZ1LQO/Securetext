A small an simple experiment with XOR encryption

Released as open source, do what you want, BUT USE AT OWN RISK!!!
I will at no point be held liable for any damage, personal as well as monetary, as a result of using this script.


My idea was to do a small experiment, allowing to encrypt small messages with predistributed
keys. The idea is so basic: physically give the receiver(s) the correct keys in person, and enjoy the freedom
of simple and safe communication of small stupid messages. It's all just for plays, read the help info in the code
see how I did it, and which thoughts I've had in the process.
Or, if you're up for it, break the 'decipher_this.dat', for which I'm the only one who has the right key to open.

If you break it, tell me!! And improve my code and make it better.

cheers
